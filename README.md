# ShadowFox_task_3
### Overview
This project involves the analysis of a weather dataset to explore precipitation patterns and their variability. Using Python and Jupyter notebooks, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover insights about weather patterns.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is weather_data_extended.csv, which contains various weather-related variables such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

### Requirements
 * Python 3.x
 * pandas
 * matplotlib
 * seaborn
 * jupyter

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-analysis.git
       cd weather-data-analysis

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

       python3 -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the dependencies:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
1. Start Jupyter Notebook
2. Open the notebook:
   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open

            weather_data_analysis.ipynb.

3. Run the cells:
     Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

### Analysis Steps
#### Step 1: Load the Dataset: 
 * Load the dataset and display its basic structure and summary statistics.

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning:
 * Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.

#### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 * Analyze the distribution of precipitation.
 * Examine precipitation variability by month (if month data is available).
 * Investigate correlations between precipitation and other variables such as temperature and humidity.

#### Step 4: Visualization:
 * Generate visualizations to present the findings, including histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots.

#### Step 5: Summary of Findings:
 * Summarize key insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
